Two travellers advance along the path, the pages of their leather notebooks filling up with sketches before nightfall... Diptyque’s history is charged with memories such as this one. Since the origins of the Maison, the Middle East and its imagery have nourished its creations. From the beginning of the 1960s, Diptyque’s founders crisscrossed the routes of the region, roaming its landscapes.Eau Rihla evokes these travels, which have inspired a perfume conceived as the chronicle of a long journey, where leather, in all its splendour, changes throughout its composition. At first, the spicy liveliness of pink peppercorn and the woody notes of Atlas cedar create a vibrant accord. Then, as iris, vanilla and saffron come into play, the fragrance warms up, softens, and takes on the comfort of a second skin. Rihla means “journey” in Arabic. A journey whose olfactory imprint instantly reawakens the memory of other inspiring and captivating horizons. A leather note was specially developed for Diptyque to enhance the composition of Eau Rihla. This natural ingredient with a leathery scent was obtained from Chinese cedar wood. It is a “vegetal” leather with an evocative fragrance.",

Firad rose essence is added to this duo, with its astonishing fruity accents of lychee, and unexpected, yet naturally present, notes: the honeyed accents of camomile, and a singular, green, vegetal accord of artichoke. After all, perfumers say that “a good rose always smells of artichoke”. A surprising detour inspired by the fantasies of nature, for a rose with a playful and exhilarating character. Firad rose is a rose extract obtained by “upcycling” the floral water that remains after an initial extraction of the flower.

Leave it in fresh water and wait until all its rosy delicacy, fruity accents, and acidulous greenery are revealed... Eau Rose is composed as an infusion of the most beautiful Damascus and centifolia roses.  Why do certain roses smell more than others? The enzyme Nudix hydrolase is involved in synthesising the molecules that make up a rose’s scent. This enzyme is found in a greater quantity in fragrant roses.",

Its intricate red patterns ripple to the rhythm of the waters, the vibrant color contrasting with the opacity of the depths. Renaissance painters had a name for this interplay of light and dark: chiaroscuro ... and this in turn inspired the name of Corail Oscuro Eau de Parfum.

The Maison's new collection, Les Essences de Diptyque (The Essences of Diptyque), freely reinterprets the treasures of nature, fluctuating between the realistic and the fantastical. Revealed in all their beauty, these treasures invite us to pause and admire them. Delicate, dreamlike, the five compositions in this collection are the product of an alliance between the perfumer's nose and the hand of an artist. Each creation celebrates one of nature's treasures – reinventing it in fragrance and exceptional drawings. Bois Corsé is a tribute to bark, the vital protective mantle that shields the vulnerable core of the tree. Exposed to the elements, it gradually takes shape, developing relief textures that are coarse, irregular and yet pleasing to the touch. In this olfactory and visual composition, which combines the work of perfumer Nathalie Cetto and her initial collaborator Olivier Pescheux – with that of drawing artist Nigel Peake, tree bark comes vividly to life. Rough, yet soothing.",

Today, paying tribute to this era and to creative friendships, the bar is immortalised in the olfactory portrait that bears its name: Orphéon. Freeze frame: plumes of tobacco smoke mingle with powdery trails of blusher, lingering on burnished wood. At the heart of the composition is the atmosphere of that unforgettable place, recognisable through the warmth of the tonka bean, the depth of cedar and the vivacity of juniper berries. Today, all that remains of Orphéon is a faceted blue column in the back of the boutique at 34 Boulevard Saint Germain.",

        "description": "During the 1960s, one scent changed the world: patchouli. Tempo pays tribute to this in three different times - three extracts from a single essence. This eau de parfum draws on its own nuances to create a composition that hovers between woody and elegant, earthy and enveloping. Elevated by voilet leaf, Tempo delivers vibrancy and a remarkable sophistication.",
        "story": "During the 60s, a certain scent was changing the world: patchouli. Tempo pays tribute to it with three extracts of this essence, a nuanced composition that hovers between elegant and woody, enveloping and earthy. Elevated by violet leaf, Tempo vibrates with remarkable sophistication. Despite its woody scent, fragrant patchouli oil is not extracted from wood, like cedar or sandalwood, but instead from the leaves of an aromatic plant in Indonesia called Nilam.
