Fleur de Peau celebrates passion and sensuality while honouring the myth of Eros and Psyche and the daughter born from their love, Hedone. At the heart of the composition is musk, its stimulating, carnal accents exalting the skin. Combined with iris, it evokes perfumes of days gone by and in particular the Renaissance era, when this accord was used for scenting gloves. Diptyque's fragrance gestures draw their inspiration from the history of perfume, reinventing textures to offer a new approach to personal fragrancing that renders the invisible perceptible and the ethereal tangible. Each of the gestures – Eau de Toilette, Shower Oil, Body Mist and Body Balm – contains a specific concentrate, with a galenic formulation designed to offer optimised olfactory reproduction. With its high concentration, it can often be used alone depending on the moment and the mood. The never-ending dance of scent and matter...",

With its high concentration, it can often be used alone depending on the moment and the mood. Matter becomes scent, scent becomes matter...",
